# SkyFeed App

SkyFeed is a real-time cross-platform client for Bluesky with a powerful Feed Builder.

It's licensed EUPL-1.2, but this repository is still missing some parts of the source code. I'm slowly cleaning it up and pushing all the files.

The web version is available on https://skyfeed.app/
